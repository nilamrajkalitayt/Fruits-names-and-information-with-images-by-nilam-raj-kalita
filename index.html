            <img src="avocado.jpg" alt="Avocado" class="fruit-image">
            <div class="fruit-info">
                <p>Avocados are nutrient-dense fruits packed with healthy monounsaturated fats, fiber, vitamins, and minerals. They are known for their creamy texture and versatility in culinary applications. Here are some key benefits and characteristics of avocados:</p>
                <p><b>Nutritional Benefits:</b></p>
                <p>Heart Health: Avocados are rich in monounsaturated fats, which can help lower bad cholesterol levels and reduce the risk of heart disease. They also provide potassium, which supports blood pressure regulation.</p>
                <p>Diabetes Management: Their low glycemic index and high fiber content make them suitable for maintaining stable blood sugar levels.</p>
                <p>Eye Health: Avocados contain lutein and zeaxanthin, carotenoids that protect the eyes from damage caused by UV light and may reduce the risk of cataracts and macular degeneration.</p>
                <p>Weight Management: Despite being high in calories, avocados' fiber and healthy fats can promote satiety and support weight management efforts.</p>
                <p><b>Storage and Ripening:</b></p>
                <p>Avocados ripen after being harvested. To speed up ripening, place them in a paper bag with a banana or apple. Once ripe, they can be stored in the refrigerator for a few days. To prevent browning of cut avocados, sprinkle with lemon or lime juice and store in an airtight container.</p>
                <p><b>Culinary Uses:</b></p>
                <p>Avocados can be diced and added to salads, blended into smoothies, mashed as a spread on toast, or used as a substitute for butter in baking recipes. They are also commonly used in guacamole and as a topping for various dishes, providing a rich, creamy texture.</p>
